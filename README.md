Looks at global macro rates and relative value analysis
EGB Trade Structure Value Finder 
Valuation originated around traded structures 

1)      Flies, Yield and Z Spread
-          (i.e. 3s5s10, 3s5s7sâ€¦ etc.) 
-          PCA flies
-          Regression of flies against each other.. i.e. 3s5s7s vs 5s7s10s 
 
2)      Curves, Yield and Z Spread
-          Curve Value vs outright levels of rates 
-          PCA Curve and are PCA weights stable through time
 
3)      Boxes
-          Ratio analysis (e.g. in 5s10s France vs Belgium Curve Box. Look at mean reversion of relativity of the points of value
-          Regression of Box vs Cross country spread level (e.g. steepness of Italy 3s7s than Germany having regressed it vs the 7y Italy Germany spread) 

4)      Cross Market Credit Flies 
-          Equal fly weightings and PCA weighted flies between three countries on the same tenor.
-          A super obvious one is FIG (Italy-France-Germany)(but they exist for everything in the EGB spectrum)
